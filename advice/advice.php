    <h2>Production of major crops</h2>
    <p>Climate of Bangladesh is quite favorable for cultivation of various crops of warm and temperate climates. 
      At present, although about 100 varieties of crops are produced in this country, rice is the main crop, as a result,
       rice is cultivated in about 77% of the total cropland (13 lakh 70 thousand hectares) in all three cropping seasons of the year.
        75 percent of the total paddy fields are high-yielding varieties.
       Other crops include wheat, jute, oilseeds, pulses, tobacco, cotton, sorghum, fruits and vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Pest</h2>
    <p>Any organism including pests, mites, nematodes, rodents or birds that attack crops and cause economic damage. 
      According to current estimates, the annual crop loss due to insects alone in Bangladesh is 16% of rice, 15% of jute, 11% of wheat, 
      20% of sugarcane, 25% of vegetables and 25% of pulses. Apart from various species of grain-eating birds and rodents, 
      a total of 700 species of insects and mites infesting stored grain and goods have been listed in the country so far, 
      of which more than two hundred species are considered as 'major' pests.
       The status of a pest as 'major' or 'minor' usually depends on the conditions prevailing in a particular ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Development of crop varieties</h2>
    <p>About 5,000 angiosperm species are among the large number of plants in Bangladesh. 
      The inhabitants of this region have cultivated a significant number of different species of plants in their way of life since ancient 
      times. The agro-ecological conditions and socio-cultural backgrounds of different communities in different regions have motivated their selection of different types of plant genetic resources. Among them, about 160 species are being cultivated in various ways. As in other regions, previously selected plant samples are used by the National Seed Board of the Government of Bangladesh for the legal registration and release of various crop production processes. In this country, the process of selection of crop varieties begins with the collection and cultivation of landraces derived from local wild flora. For example, it is in this region that today's rice species Oryza sativa originated, of which there are numerous cultivars and varieties. According to the report given by the 'Bengal Famine Commission' in the early sixties of the 19th century, by 1905, Bengali farms and laboratories were established throughout the Indian subcontinent. At this time, emphasis was placed on the selection and registration of varieties of rice, jute and other important crops under cultivation.
       The process and time of origin of various crop varieties are mentioned in the following list.</p>

    <h2>Farm input and implement</h2>
    <p>Irrigation water and inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, labor and pesticides are natural 
      determinants of crop production. Balanced application of these inputs can only ensure high yield of a crop at the farm level. 
      As seed is a basic input research and extension activities are carried out for production and supply of high quality seeds of 
      high yielding varieties of crops. To date, a significant number of high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat, maize, jute, sugarcane, 
      pulses and oilseeds, tuber crops and vegetables have been released for production and on-farm use. Farmers usually save their own seed. Earlier, the government agency Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation supplied only certified seeds, but almost never supplied more than five percent of the total demand. 
      Currently, many privately owned companies are engaged in seed business.</p>
